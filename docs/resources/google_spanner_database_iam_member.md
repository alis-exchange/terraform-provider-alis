# alis_google_spanner_database_iam_member (Resource)

Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the table are preserved.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    alis = {
      source  = "alis-exchange/alis"
      version = "1.1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "alis" {

}

resource "alis_google_spanner_database_iam_member" "editor" {
  project  = var.ALIS_OS_PROJECT
  instance = var.ALIS_OS_SPANNER_INSTANCE
  database = "tf-test"
  role     = "roles/editor"
  member   = "serviceAccount:${var.ALIS_OS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT}"
}

output "test_iam" {
  description = "The IAM policy for the database"
  value       = alis_google_spanner_database_iam_member.editor
}
```

> **Warning ⚠️**
>
> `alis_google_spanner_database_iam_policy` cannot be used in conjunction with `alis_google_spanner_database_iam_binding` and `alis_google_spanner_database_iam_member` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
>
> In addition, be careful not to accidentally unset ownership of the table as google_bigtable_table_iam_policy replaces the entire policy.

> **Warning ⚠️**
>
> `alis_google_spanner_database_iam_binding` resources can be used in conjunction with `alis_google_spanner_database_iam_member` resources only if they do not grant privilege to the same role.
